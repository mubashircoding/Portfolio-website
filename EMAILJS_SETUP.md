# EmailJS Setup Guide

## Why Emails Aren't Being Sent

The contact form isn't sending emails because the EmailJS configuration is missing. You need to set up environment variables with your EmailJS credentials.

## Step 1: Create .env.local File

Create a file called `.env.local` in your project root (same level as `package.json`) with the following content:

```bash
# EmailJS Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=your_service_id_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=your_template_id_here
```

## Step 2: Get Your EmailJS Credentials

1. **Go to [EmailJS Dashboard](https://dashboard.emailjs.com/)**
2. **Sign up/Login** to your account
3. **Get your Public Key** from Account â†’ API Keys
4. **Create a Service** (Gmail, Outlook, etc.) and get the Service ID
5. **Create an Email Template** and get the Template ID

## Step 3: Update .env.local

Replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=abc123def456ghi789
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=service_xyz123
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=template_abc456
```

## Step 4: Restart Your Development Server

After creating `.env.local`, restart your Next.js development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

## Step 5: Test the Configuration

1. **Click "Check EmailJS Config"** button on the contact page
2. **Check browser console** for configuration status
3. **Try submitting the form** - you should now receive emails!

## Email Template Variables

Your EmailJS template should use these variable names:
- `{{user_name}}` - User's full name
- `{{user_email}}` - User's email address
- `{{subject}}` - Email subject
- `{{message}}` - User's message

## Troubleshooting

- **Check browser console** for error messages
- **Verify environment variables** are loaded (should show "SET" not "NOT SET")
- **Ensure EmailJS service is active** in your dashboard
- **Check spam folder** for test emails
